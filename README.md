# Texture Mapping on Rotating Cube with OpenGL and C

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement texture mapping on a rotating 3D cube using OpenGL and C. Texture mapping enhances the appearance of 3D objects by applying images (textures) to their surfaces, resulting in a more realistic visual effect.

## Features

- Rotating 3D cube
- Texture mapping on each face of the cube
- Configurable rotation speed
- Simple structure for easy understanding and modification

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- OpenGL development libraries (GL, GLU, GLUT)
- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of C programming and OpenGL

## Change texture

replace wall.jpg image with your texture.
